				<h3>The Clone Wars</h3>

				<br>
				<p>This is my content about the clone wars. Building a completely functional replica of a droid from Star Wars isn’t a simple undertaking. The R2-D2 Builders group facilitates constructing astromechs with templates, instructions, and helpful advice, but it’s definitely the kind of project that requires a commitment. If you want an astromech but aren’t married to the idea of making it screen-accurate or giving it moving parts, there are other options. LEGO bricks are one way to go. Everyday household objects you can find at your local hardware and craft stores are another route. In this instance, choosing the simpler path doesn’t mean you’re crossing to the dark side.</P>

				<p>Sandy and Ariane Kamps, toy store co-owners and parents of four younglings, used the everyday-object method to make their very own Chopper. The Star Wars Rebels droid is known for being gruff and sassy, but his taciturn demeanor doesn’t keep fans from falling head over heels for him. The Kamps’ three-year-old daughter is in love with Chopper, so it was only natural that they decided to make a replica.</p>
